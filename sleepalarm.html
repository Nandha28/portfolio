    <h1>ANTI-SLEEP ALARM FOR DRIVERS</h1>
    <img src="images/IMG_20230424_143751.jpg" alt="Anti-Sleep Alarm System" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p><strong>Team Members: </strong>Four members from Karpagam College of Engineering collaborated on this project.</p>
    <p><strong>Institution:</strong>Karpagam College of Engineering</p>
    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong>Develop an innovative system to enhance road safety by detecting driver drowsiness and alerting the driver.</p>
    <p><strong>Technology:</strong>Utilize Arduino microcontroller and ultrasonic sensor for real-time monitoring.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Component:</strong> Integration of a buzzer to provide immediate auditory alerts to the driver.</p>

    <h3>FUNCTIONALITY</h3>
    <li>The IR sensor continuously monitors the driver's eye movements and blinks.
</li>
<li>When the system detects prolonged eye closure or irregular eye movements, it triggers the relay.</li>
<li>The relay, upon activation, signals the buzzer to emit a loud alarm, alerting the driver.</li>
   
<h3>KEY FEATURES:</h3>
    <p><strong>Real-time Monitoring:</strong>Constantly analyzes driver behavior for signs of drowsiness such as head movements and eye closures.</p>
    <p><strong>IR Sensor: </strong>Detects driver's eye movements and blinks, crucial indicators of drowsiness.</p>
    <p><strong>Buzzer Alert:</strong>Activates a loud and distinctive sound to immediately alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.</p>
    <p><strong>Customizable Alerts: </strong>The system can be configured to provide various alert types based on driver preferences and vehicle setup</p>

    <h3>IMPACT AND BENEFITS:</h3>
    <p><strong>Enhanced Safety:</strong>Mitigates risks associated with driver fatigue, reducing the chances of accidents due to lapses in concentration.</p>
    <p><strong>Prompt Intervention:</strong>Ensures drivers are alerted promptly, allowing them to take corrective actions or rest as needed.
</p>
    <p><strong>Innovative Solution:</strong>Showcases the application of technology in addressing critical road safety challenges.</p>
    <p><strong>Scalability:</strong>Can be adapted for use in different vehicle types and driving conditions, contributing to broader safety initiatives.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<li>The anti-sleep alarm system developed by our team showcases our technical expertise and commitment to road safety innovation.</li>
<li>Our collaborative efforts and utilization of IR sensor technology, relay control, and buzzer integration demonstrate effective problem-solving and engineering skills.
</li>
<li>This project aligns with our goal of leveraging technology for practical solutions that positively impact road safety and driver well-being.</li>
