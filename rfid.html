    <p>
      Our team of four members from Karpagam College of Engineering has
      successfully designed and implemented an RFID-based security system for
      home locks. The system utilizes RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
      technology to enhance home security by providing secure access control.
    </p>

    <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>1.RFID Technology:</strong>The system employs RFID tags and readers
      for access control, ensuring secure and convenient entry to the home.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2.Secure Authentication:</strong> Authorized users are granted access via
      RFID tags, which are uniquely programmed for each user, preventing
      unauthorized entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3.Multiple User Support: </strong>The system supports multiple
      users, with each user having their unique RFID tag for personalized access
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4.Real-time Monitoring: </strong>The system provides real-time
      monitoring of access events, allowing homeowners to track who enters and
      exits the premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>5.Integration Capability:</strong>The system can be integrated
      with other security measures such as alarms or surveillance cameras for
      comprehensive home security.
    </p>
    <h3>IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
    <p>
      Our team designed the system using Arduino microcontrollers, RFID readers,
      and RFID tags. We programmed the microcontrollers to interface with the
      RFID readers and manage access control based on authorized RFID tag
      information.
    </p>
    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
    <p>
      The RFID-based home security system developed by our team offers a
      reliable and efficient solution for enhancing home security. With its
      robust authentication mechanism and real-time monitoring capabilities, the
      system provides homeowners with peace of mind knowing that their property
      is well-protected against unauthorized access.
